# How to conncet gcp project to vscode
In this page I keep track of every steps should be taken in order to conncet gcp(Google Cloud Platform) to vscode(Visual Studio Code).

First of all the following page helped me to do so:
[Unleash the power of Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on Google Cloud Platform Virtual Machine](https://towardsdatascience.com/unleash-the-power-of-visual-studio-code-vscode-on-google-cloud-platform-virtual-machine-f75f78f49aee)
but I am going to customize it for myself.


## Delete a project of gcp
`gcp/IAM & Admin/manage resources` find the project and delete it.


## Pre-requisites
-Create a virtual machine
